If I were to say what is the most important, I would say liberty arts education is the most important. Beacause Liberty arts education emphases that this concept that it really doesn't teach too much, and I feel like it's something lacks in Chinese high school is this concept that you should be challenging what you have been taught. It's not about the session, it's not about your grades, it's about the ability of thinking.
